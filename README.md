This jquery snippet was used on my personal site. 

Three pages on the site had 4 large panels of differing sizes. When the user clicks on the panel it expands to to show the 
details of that section. The expanded section is then closed and the orginal state of the page is maintained.

Basically some front end eye candy.

It was heavily influenced by the folks at this site: http://wearelanding.com/
